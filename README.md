# mkg-infra

My own personal infrastructure template, open-sourced as FOSS.

> WIP, there is more to come (and also a bunch of things will get re-written)

### Why do I publish this?
Mainly because open-sourcing things is a great motivation for me to write better code, as the world can actually see it.
